# BlueStaffyUK Session Log and Known Issues

History and open defects. Nothing here is a rule; it is state. The source repo's log was
replaced wholesale rather than re-based — it was eighteen months of another site's build
history, and translating it would have invented a past this repo does not have.

## Project 1 — Foundation (2026-09-15/16) — COMPLETE

The Astro 6.3.8 static site, the rule packs, the Python suite and the render harness.
Full report and evidence: `docs/reports/foundation-gate-report.md`.

## Project 2 — System transfer (2026-09-16/17) — COMPLETE

Moves the site operating system — rules, agents, skills, gate scripts and reference docs —
from the source repo into this one, re-based onto a Glasgow Staffordshire Bull
Terrier breeder, with `scripts/marker_check.py` as the zero-tolerance
proof. `data/port-manifest.json` is the record of every file that crossed.
Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-16-system-transfer.md`.

Closed 2026-09-17 on branch `system-transfer`, 57 commits, `6c1f2c3..939033b` plus the
close-out commit, no remote and nothing pushed. Every gate was run twice with identical
results; the transcript is `docs/reports/system-transfer-run.log`. Full report and evidence:
`docs/reports/system-transfer-gate-report.md`.

Headline numbers: the marker gate went 418 → 0 (`examined 233 files; 0 problems`); the
manifest carries 180 rows (10 copy, 129 rebase, 41 deferred) and `scripts/port_from_cag.py` reports
`missing 0, blocked 0` with no rebase row re-applied on the second run; 36 agents and 53
skills in the single `.claude` tree with both registries generated and in sync; 1240 pytest
tests pass; the render meta gate is at 315 passed and the pages gate at the recorded Project
2 baseline with no new blocking row.

Credentials moved out of the MCP server and into a gitignored `.env` holding eleven keys by
name (values never printed, never committed). The `bluestaffyuk` MCP block was removed from
the Claude desktop config, which was backed up first as
`claude_desktop_config.json.bak-20260917-022840`; `~/bsuk-mcp-server` was deleted. Only
`gscServer` remains.

## Known Issues

Seeded from the Foundation gate report's "Open items" 1–8 and extended by project 2's gate
report. Items 1 and 2 are closed by project 2; 3–8 are carried forward with their owning
project; 9–14 are new from the system transfer.

1. **`FORM_ENDPOINT` contract — CLOSED by project 2.** The contact-page form contract was
   re-based onto this repo's own fields and endpoint env key. See
   `scripts/form_contract_audit.py` and `tests/render/checks/form.ts`.
2. **The DUP whitelist — CLOSED by project 2.** The duplicate-content whitelist was
   re-based onto this site's own built pages, together with the fixture that depends on
   its stems. See `scripts/dup_content_audit.py`.
3. **The orphan check is blinded by the catch-all route.** `builtRoutesWithoutSource()` in
   `tests/render/lib/freshness.ts` compares built routes to source routes, and the
   root-level `src/pages/[...post].astro` matches any path — so while it exists the
   function cannot prove any route orphaned, static pages included. The mtime comparison is
   the only remaining freshness signal. A real answer needs a check that reads the content
   collection rather than the filesystem. **Carried forward.**
4. **Puppy `srcset` 2x rows.** 15 blocking rows over 6 pages, the same images as the puppy
   page's 2277 ms LCP. **Project 3's image pass** should fix both at once.
5. **`nav-jump-target-lands` baseline.** 18 rows over 6 pages remain after the shell fix.
   `--hdr` is measured from the header (`--hdr-measured`), with the media query kept as the
   no-JS fallback, so the remaining rows are migrated in-page anchors rather than chrome
   miscalculation. **Carried forward.**
6. **17 stub locations are noindexed.** They carry 0–7 words of legacy body.
   **Project 5** writes them; `scripts/sitemap_check.py` keeps them out of the shards until
   then.
7. **Placeholders.** Five stand-in tokens are still in the tree. This entry describes them
   rather than naming them: `docs/reference` is itself a placeholder scan root, so spelling
   a token here would register as a permanent hit and the gate would never reach zero on
   launch day. The exact token names and counts are in
   `docs/reports/system-transfer-gate-report.md`, which is not a scan root.
   The site-URL stand-in and the phone stand-in resolve at **project 6** launch; the
   form-endpoint stand-in is already clear, because the build reads the endpoint from `.env`.
   The two legal-claim stand-ins — the breeder-licence claim and the Lucy's-Law claim — were
   added by project 2's skill re-base and await **Lisa Bright's** confirmation of the
   wording. `BSUK_RELEASE=1 npm run check:placeholders` refuses to ship any of them
   (exit 1, confirmed).
8. **`schema-date-modified-present`.** 18 rows over 6 pages; needs
   `scripts/generate_page_dates.py` wired into the content pass, which arrives with
   **project 4** — the same project that gives pages a real edit history for sitemap
   `lastmod`.

9. **Three carried header duplicates.** `board_gate.py index` reports three
   `header-collision` FAILs in migrated copy: the homepage's *Meet the Proud Parents of Our
   Blue Staffy Puppies* and *Our Commitment to the Health of Our Blue Staffy Puppies*
   against `/uk-locations/staffy-breeding-dogs-glasgow/`, and *How to Buy Your Blue Staffy
   Puppy* against `/uk-blue-staffy-puppy-buying-guide/`. Down from five; the two chrome rows
   cleared with the harness re-base. **Project 4.**
10. **Deferred-check id drift.** `bottom-bar-under-tabbar` and `analytics-double-load` are
    Python page-hardening checks in the source repo, not render-harness checks, so they could
    not be deferred in `tests/render/targets.json`. Defer them if a later project ports them
    into the harness.
11. **Old price range in migrated copy.** A pre-migration price band, below the locked
    £1,500 / £1,700, persists in several migrated page bodies (see the project-2 gate
    report, open item 11, for the exact pages). The fact lint covers `.claude/agents` and
    `.claude/skills` only; page bodies are content. **Project 4.**
12. **`Sharine Amelia` byline.** The migrated author byline persists on the homepage and the
    breeders page. **Project 4.**
13. **`INDEXNOW_KEY` empty, `SITE_URL` still the placeholder.** IndexNow and pagefind are
    ported and guarded (`scripts/indexnow_submit.py` exits 2 without `BSUK_RELEASE=1` and again on
    the placeholder; `build:release` sits behind `scripts/release_guard.sh`). There is no
    deploy script — the source repo pushed to a host and this repo has none. **Project 6.**
14. **GSC and GA4 pulls are unwired.** The eight keys are in `.env` and named in
    `docs/reference/credentials.md`, but no script reads them yet. **Project 6.**

15. **Two live credential values were committed in this branch — ROTATION PENDING.**
    `.claude/skills/bsuk-indexing/SKILL.md` carried the live values of `GSC_CLIENT_SECRET`
    and `GA4_CLIENT_ID` inside an OAuth token-exchange example, from the skills re-base
    (`7a89519`) through the first close-out commit (`eed05a5`). The literals were replaced
    with `$GSC_CLIENT_SECRET` / `$GA4_CLIENT_ID` at the close-out, but they remain in this
    branch's git history. The branch has **no remote** and was never pushed; however the
    identical values are in the source repo's own indexing skill, which is tracked and
    pushed to its GitHub origin, so the OAuth client is exposed regardless of BSUK's local
    history.
    **Action required by the user: rotate the GSC OAuth client and the GA4 client in the
    Google Cloud Console — new client secret, refresh tokens re-minted — before project 6
    wires up the GSC and GA4 pulls.** No agent can do this. Two guards now prove the absence
    on every run: `tests/py/test_no_env_value_committed.py` (every `.env` value against all
    tracked files, the run log and the Artifacts) and `tests/py/test_secret_shapes.py`
    (credential shapes across the marker gate's roots plus reports, artifacts, scorecards and
    fixtures). Full account: `docs/reports/system-transfer-gate-report.md` § Credentials and
    MCP → Incident. **Open until rotated.** 2026-09-18: the source repo's working copy and
    its legacy skill file were scrubbed to env refs and committed locally (not pushed);
    rotation still pending.

16. **The breeder has relocated: Carlisle, Cumbria, England — not Glasgow.** Confirmed by
    the user 2026-09-18 during the build 3 brainstorm, as a full relocation of the business
    and the website. Address is town-level only (Carlisle, Cumbria) until the breeder says
    otherwise. Everything that currently says Glasgow is now wrong: the homepage and page
    copy, `data/settings.json`, the schema `address` / `areaServed`, the fact lint's locked
    geography in `tests/py/test_agent_facts.py`, agents and skills, and
    `/uk-locations/staffy-breeding-dogs-glasgow/`, which becomes an outreach page rather
    than the home base. **Build 3** carries Carlisle in the logo lockups and tokens only;
    **build 4** rewrites the copy and settings; **build 5** re-plans the 28 locations around
    Carlisle (Cumbria, the Borders, the North West and North East are now the near ring).
    One strand of this debt is machine-readable and easy to miss: the form contract's
    `PUPPY_OPTION` constant in `scripts/form_contract_audit.py`, and the matching
    `<option>` value and visible label in `src/components/ContactForm.astro`, name the old
    city in a collection choice — so the gate currently *requires* the wrong geography of
    every page it audits in full, and the shipped contact page offers a collection point
    the breeder has left. **Build 4** re-bases all three together when it replaces the
    contact form with `src/components/kit/ContactFormKit.astro`, which carries no such
    option (design-system spec §11 amendment 2).
